- Figure out why breakpoints don't work.

- More testing.



~~~~~  ON COMPLETION  ~~~~~

    ~~ Project ~~         
        ~ Extract, safe commits/pushes
            ~ Delete unnecessary assets
                ~ Commit/push new, shrunken down build

    ~~ Setup itch.io game page ~~    
        ~ explain controls 
        ~ description







~~~~~  MAY OR MAY NOT ADD  ~~~~~

- Die animations exist for Mage/Archer, but they pose too weirdly on death.
- Archer/Mage need better attack animations?


~~~~~  AUDIO  ~~~~~
    - General audio effects


[Improve Wall background?]



[If enemy types change per level]
    - Enemies for each level
        - ... that use 'weaker' abilities
    - Acquire particles for each level    
    - Sequences for each level        

- When currentKey needs held, should letting go before its holdDuration is reached fails the sequence?
~ Should player be able to select a target if their attack is non-AoE?
~ Should players have their Renderers flicker quickly upon taking damage?
~ Show damage (as text) taken for all characters?
