After done testing:
    - Revert health on heroes
    - Revert damage on certain player characters
    - Reset time scales

- Bug: Arcane Mage killed 1 target. Reflected Archer's attack. Was able to continue after killing both remaining targets.

- Fully tweak attack particle positions to fit cleanly with every single player character

- Clear certain Instances between levels?


- Lots of testing.

- Bug fixing.

~~~~~  MAY OR MAY NOT ADD  ~~~~~

- Die animations exist for Mage/Archer, but they pose too weirdly on death.
- Archer/Mage need better attack animations?


~~~~~  AUDIO  ~~~~~
    - General audio effects


[Improve Wall background?]



[If enemy types change per level]
    - Enemies for each level
        - ... that use 'weaker' abilities
    - Acquire particles for each level    
    - Sequences for each level        

- When currentKey needs held, should letting go before its holdDuration is reached fails the sequence?
~ Should player be able to select a target if their attack is non-AoE?
~ Should players have their Renderers flicker quickly upon taking damage?
~ Show damage (as text) taken for all characters?
